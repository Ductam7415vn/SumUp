# SumUp App Test Cases

## 📝 Test Case 1: Basic Text Summarization

### Input Text:
```
Climate change represents one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. The Earth's average temperature has risen by approximately 1.1 degrees Celsius since the pre-industrial era, primarily due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These activities release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere, creating a heat-trapping effect. The consequences are already visible: melting ice caps, rising sea levels, more frequent extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems worldwide. Scientists warn that without immediate action to reduce emissions, global temperatures could rise by 3-4 degrees Celsius by 2100, leading to catastrophic impacts on food security, water resources, and human settlements. International efforts like the Paris Agreement aim to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, but this requires rapid transformation of energy systems, transportation, and industrial practices.
```

### Expected Output (General Persona):
```
• Climate change is a critical 21st-century challenge with Earth's temperature rising 1.1°C since pre-industrial times
• Human activities like fossil fuel burning and deforestation release greenhouse gases causing heat-trapping effects
• Visible impacts include melting ice caps, rising seas, extreme weather, and ecosystem disruptions
• Without action, temperatures could rise 3-4°C by 2100, threatening food, water, and settlements
• Paris Agreement targets 1.5°C limit requiring rapid transformation of energy and industrial systems
```

### Expected Metrics:
- Original words: ~150
- Summary words: ~65

## 🎓 Test Case 2: Academic Persona

### Input Text:
```
Artificial Intelligence has evolved from a theoretical concept to a transformative technology reshaping various industries. Machine learning algorithms enable computers to learn from data without explicit programming, while deep learning uses neural networks inspired by the human brain. Natural language processing allows machines to understand and generate human language, powering applications like chatbots and translation services. Computer vision enables machines to interpret visual information, revolutionizing fields from medical imaging to autonomous vehicles. However, AI development raises ethical concerns including bias in algorithms, job displacement, privacy issues, and the need for explainable AI. Researchers emphasize the importance of responsible AI development that considers societal impacts and ensures benefits are distributed equitably.
```

### Expected Output (Academic Persona):
```
• Artificial Intelligence has transitioned from theoretical framework to applied technology across multiple domains
• Core methodologies include machine learning (pattern recognition from data) and deep learning (neural network architectures)
• Key applications: NLP for human-computer interaction and computer vision for visual data interpretation
• Ethical considerations encompass algorithmic bias, employment impacts, and transparency requirements
• Academic discourse emphasizes responsible development paradigms ensuring equitable societal benefits

## 🧑‍🎓 Test Case 4: Student Persona

### Input Text:
```
The Renaissance was a period of cultural rebirth that began in Italy during the 14th century and spread throughout Europe. It marked the transition from the Middle Ages to modernity. Key characteristics included renewed interest in classical Greek and Roman culture, humanism emphasizing individual achievement, and revolutionary developments in art, science, and literature. Leonardo da Vinci exemplified the Renaissance ideal of the "universal man," excelling as an artist, scientist, and inventor. The printing press, invented by Gutenberg around 1440, democratized knowledge by making books widely available. This period saw masterpieces like Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling and Shakespeare's plays. The Renaissance laid foundations for the Scientific Revolution and modern Western culture.
```

### Expected Output (Student Persona):
```
• Renaissance = cultural rebirth starting in Italy (14th century), spreading across Europe
• Main ideas: loved Greek/Roman stuff, focused on individual achievements, huge advances in art/science
• Leonardo da Vinci = perfect example (artist + scientist + inventor all in one!)
• Gutenberg's printing press (1440) = game changer for spreading knowledge
• Famous works: Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel, Shakespeare's plays → influenced modern culture
```

## 🔬 Test Case 5: Technical Persona

### Input Text:
```
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It uses a declarative configuration model where users define desired state in YAML files. The architecture consists of a control plane managing worker nodes that run application containers in pods. Key components include the API server for communication, etcd for storing cluster state, scheduler for pod placement, and kubelet agents on each node. Kubernetes provides features like automatic rollouts and rollbacks, service discovery and load balancing, storage orchestration, and self-healing capabilities. It supports horizontal pod autoscaling based on CPU utilization or custom metrics. Best practices include using namespaces for multi-tenancy, implementing resource limits, and following the principle of least privilege for RBAC.
```

### Expected Output (Technical Persona):
```
• Kubernetes: container orchestration platform using declarative YAML configurations for desired state
• Architecture: control plane (API server, etcd, scheduler) manages worker nodes running pods via kubelet
• Core features: automated rollouts/rollbacks, service discovery, load balancing, storage orchestration
• Self-healing with horizontal pod autoscaling based on CPU/custom metrics
• Best practices: namespace isolation, resource limits, RBAC with least privilege principle
```
