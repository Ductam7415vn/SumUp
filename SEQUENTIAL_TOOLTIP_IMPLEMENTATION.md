# Sequential Tooltip Implementation Summary

## Overview
The tooltip system has been updated to display tooltips sequentially (one after another) instead of showing only one tooltip per app session.

## Key Changes

### 1. MainViewModel Updates
- Added tooltip queue to manage sequential display
- Modified `dismissFeatureTip()` to automatically show the next tooltip after 500ms delay
- Added `showNextTooltip()` private method to display the next tooltip in queue
- Added `skipAllTooltips()` to mark all tooltips as shown and clear the queue

### 2. ImprovedFeatureTooltip Component
Created a new enhanced tooltip component with:
- Progress indicators showing "Tip X of Y"
- Visual progress bar
- "Skip All" button for users who want to bypass all tooltips
- "Next" button for tooltips that aren't the last one
- "Got it" button for the final tooltip
- Smooth animations and haptic feedback

### 3. MainScreen Integration
- Updated to use `ImprovedFeatureDiscoveryTooltip` component
- Calculates current tooltip index for progress display
- Properly connects dismiss, next, and skip all actions

## How It Works

1. When `checkAndShowFeatureDiscovery()` is called:
   - All unshown tips are loaded into the tooltip queue
   - The first tooltip is displayed

2. When user clicks "Next" or dismisses a tooltip:
   - Current tooltip is marked as shown
   - After 500ms delay, the next tooltip in queue is displayed
   - Progress indicators update to show current position

3. When user clicks "Skip All":
   - All tooltips are marked as shown
   - Queue is cleared
   - No more tooltips will appear

## User Benefits
- Users can learn about all features in one session
- Progress indicators show how many tips remain
- Option to skip all provides control for experienced users
- Sequential flow feels more natural and educational
