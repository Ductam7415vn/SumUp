# Processing Screen Fixes

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Wrong ProcessingScreen File**
- **Issue**: You were looking at `/presentation/components/ProcessingScreen.kt` (old file)
- **Reality**: App uses `/presentation/screens/processing/ProcessingScreen.kt` (correct file)
- **Fix**: Focus on the correct file in `screens/processing/`

### 2. **Race Condition in Navigation**
- **Issue**: Both MainScreen AND ProcessingScreen were trying to handle navigation to ResultScreen
- **Cause**: Duplicate LaunchedEffect in MainScreen was clearing navigation state before ProcessingScreen could read it
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate navigation handling from MainScreen (lines 380-391)

### 3. **Progress Bar Not Moving**
- **Possible Cause**: UI not ready when progress starts
- **Fix**: Increased initial delay from 100ms to 300ms in MainViewModel

### 4. **Navigation State Not Cleared**
- **Issue**: Navigation state wasn't being reset after navigation
- **Fix**: Added `viewModel.onResultNavigationHandled()` after navigation in ProcessingScreen

## Current Flow (Fixed)

1. **User clicks "Summarize"** in MainScreen
2. **Navigate to ProcessingScreen** via `navigateToProcessing = true`
3. **ProcessingScreen shows**:
   - Progress bar animation (0-90% over 2 seconds)
   - Real API call happens in parallel
4. **When API completes**:
   - MainViewModel sets `navigateToResult = true` and `summaryId = "xxx"`
   - ProcessingScreen detects this and calls `onComplete(summaryId)`
   - Navigation state is reset
5. **Navigate to ResultScreen** with the summary ID

## Debug Logs Added

To help debug, I've added these logs:
- Progress updates: Shows current progress value and source
- Navigation checks: Shows when navigation conditions are checked
- Mock mode status: Shows if mock mode is active

## What to Check

Run the app and check logcat for:
```
ProcessingScreen: Progress updated: X.X
ProcessingScreen: Navigation check - navigateToResult: true/false, summaryId: xxx
ProcessingScreen: Calling onComplete with summaryId: xxx
MainViewModel: Setting navigateToResult=true, summaryId=xxx
```

## If Still Not Working

1. **Check API Key**: Make sure you have a valid Gemini API key in settings
2. **Check Network**: Ensure internet connection is working
3. **Check Logs**: Look for error messages in logcat
4. **Mock Mode**: Make sure `isMockMode` is set to `false` in TransitionNavigation.kt (line 116)

The main fix was removing the duplicate navigation handling that was causing a race condition. The app should now properly show the progress bar animation and navigate to results when the API call completes.
