# Summary Length Feature Fix

## Issue
The Brief, Standard, and Detailed summary length options were not producing different results. All three options were generating the same summary length.

## Root Causes

### 1. GeminiPromptBuilder Override
The `calculateDynamicLength` function in `GeminiPromptBuilder.kt` was overriding the requested length based on input text size, ignoring the user's selection:
```kotlin
// Before (incorrect):
return when {
    textLength <= 1000 -> 300
    textLength <= 5000 -> 500
    // etc...
}.coerceAtLeast(baseMaxLength)
```

### 2. MockGeminiApiService Ignoring Length
The mock service wasn't using the `maxLength` parameter from the request at all. It was generating fixed summaries regardless of the selected option.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed GeminiPromptBuilder
Removed the override logic to respect the requested length:
```kotlin
// After (correct):
private fun calculateDynamicLength(text: String, baseMaxLength: Int): Int {
    // Just use the requested length - don't override it
    return baseMaxLength
}
```

### 2. Updated MockGeminiApiService
Made the mock service respond differently based on `maxLength`:
- **Brief (0-300)**: Shorter summaries, 3 bullet points, 2 insights
- **Standard (301-600)**: Medium summaries, 5 bullet points, 4 insights  
- **Detailed (600+)**: Comprehensive summaries, 6+ bullet points, 6 insights

## How It Works Now

1. **User Selection** → **Multiplier**:
   - Brief: 0.5x
   - Standard: 1.0x
   - Detailed: 1.5x

2. **Base Length Calculation** (in SummaryRepositoryImpl):
   ```kotlin
   val baseLength = when (text.length) {
       in 0..1000 -> 300
       in 1001..5000 -> 500
       in 5001..15000 -> 800
       in 15001..30000 -> 1000
       else -> 1200
   }
   ```

3. **Final Length** = baseLength × multiplier
   - For 2000-char text with Brief: 500 × 0.5 = 250 chars
   - For 2000-char text with Standard: 500 × 1.0 = 500 chars
   - For 2000-char text with Detailed: 500 × 1.5 = 750 chars

## Testing
Now when you select different summary lengths:
- **Brief**: Produces concise summaries with fewer bullet points
- **Standard**: Balanced summaries with moderate detail
- **Detailed**: Comprehensive summaries with extensive analysis

The mock service (used when no API key is present) now properly simulates these differences for testing.
