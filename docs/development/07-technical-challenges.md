## **Current Technical Challenges**

### **1. PDF Processing (Broken - High Priority)**
**Issue:** PDFBox dependencies missing from build.gradle.kts
**Impact:** Runtime crash when attempting PDF operations
**Fix:** Add `implementation "com.tom-roush:pdfbox-android:2.0.27.0"`
**Time:** 30 minutes

### **2. Mock AI Service (Acceptable for Academic)**
**Issue:** MockGeminiApiService limits real functionality demonstration
**Current:** Provides realistic responses but no actual AI processing
**Options:** Gemini API (free), OpenAI GPT (paid), or local AI models
**Time:** 2-4 hours for real integration

### **3. Testing Implementation (Nice to Have)**
**Issue:** Test structure exists but no actual test implementations
**Impact:** No automated quality assurance
**Solution:** Implement unit tests for use cases and ViewModels
**Time:** 4-8 hours for comprehensive coverage
