# Welcome Card Implementation for First-Time Users

## Overview
A welcome card has been implemented to greet new users who haven't created any summaries yet, providing guidance and encouraging them to create their first summary.

## Implementation Details

### 1. **WelcomeCard Component** (`WelcomeCard.kt`)
- Animated welcome message with app icon
- Shows 3 quick start options: Type text, Upload PDF, Scan text
- Dismissible with close button
- Smooth animations and haptic feedback
- Auto-hides after user dismisses it

### 2. **State Management**
- Added `showWelcomeCard` to `MainUiState`
- Logic in `MainViewModel`:
  - Checks if `totalCount == 0` (no summaries created)
  - Checks if user has seen welcome card before
  - Shows card only for first-time users

### 3. **Persistence**
- Uses `DraftManager` to store welcome card state
- `hasSeenWelcomeCard` preference prevents showing again
- Survives app restarts

### 4. **Display Conditions**
The welcome card appears when:
- User has never created a summary (`totalCount == 0`)
- User hasn't dismissed the welcome card before
- User is on the main screen

### 5. **User Experience**
- **First Launch**: Shows onboarding â†’ Main screen with welcome card
- **After First Summary**: Welcome card never appears again
- **Manual Dismiss**: User can close card anytime

## Visual Design
- Primary container background with gradient
- Animated star icon with pulse effect
- Three quick-start chips showing input methods
- Friendly, encouraging copy
- Matches app's Material 3 design system

## Code Changes
1. Created `WelcomeCard.kt` component
2. Updated `MainUiState` with `showWelcomeCard` field
3. Added welcome card logic to `MainViewModel`
4. Updated `DraftManager` with welcome card persistence
5. Integrated into `MainScreen` layout

## Benefits
- Better first-time user experience
- Clear guidance on how to start
- Reduces friction for new users
- Encourages engagement with visual cues
