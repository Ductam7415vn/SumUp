# API Usage Tracking Verification Report

## Implementation Status

### ✅ IMPLEMENTED Components:

1. **EnhancedGeminiApiService** (Line 86-92)
   - Correctly calls `apiKeyManager.updateKeyUsage()` after successful API calls
   - Passes the active key ID for tracking

2. **NetworkModule** (Line 185)
   - Properly instantiates `EnhancedGeminiApiService` with `enhancedApiKeyManager`
   - The API key manager is injected correctly

3. **SettingsViewModel**
   - Line 400: Populates `apiUsageStats` from `enhancedApiKeyManager.getUsageStats()`
   - Line 464-469: Has `refreshUsageStats()` method to update stats
   - Lines 389-405: Observes API keys and updates UI state with usage stats

4. **SettingsScreen** (Lines 242-247)
   - Displays `ApiUsageDashboard` when `uiState.apiUsageStats` is not null
   - Connected to refresh action

5. **ApiUsageDashboard**
   - Full implementation with charts, metrics, and refresh functionality
   - Displays daily/weekly/monthly usage statistics

### 🔍 Potential Issues to Check:

1. **Null Check in EnhancedGeminiApiService**
   - The usage tracking only happens if `apiKeyManager` is not null
   - Need to verify that `apiKeyManager` is always provided

2. **Active Key ID**
   - Line 88: `manager.activeKeyId.value` - need to ensure this is populated
   - If no active key is selected, usage won't be tracked

3. **Data Persistence**
   - Check if `saveApiKeys()` in `EnhancedApiKeyManager` is working correctly
   - Verify SharedPreferences are saving the usage data

### 📝 Debug Steps Added:

1. Added logging to `ApiUsageDashboard` render method
2. Added logging to `updateKeyUsage` method in `EnhancedApiKeyManager`
3. Added logging to `getUsageStats` method

### 🧪 Testing Recommendations:

1. **Check if API key is active:**
   ```kotlin
   // In SettingsViewModel or where you need to verify
   Log.d("TEST", "Active key ID: ${enhancedApiKeyManager.activeKeyId.value}")
   ```

2. **Force a test update:**
   ```kotlin
   // In MainViewModel after API call
   enhancedApiKeyManager.activeKeyId.value?.let { keyId ->
       enhancedApiKeyManager.updateKeyUsage(keyId)
       Log.d("TEST", "Manually updated usage for key: $keyId")
   }
   ```

3. **Check SharedPreferences:**
   ```bash
   adb shell run-as com.example.sumup cat /data/data/com.example.sumup/shared_prefs/sumup_prefs.xml
   ```

### 🚨 Most Likely Issue:

The API usage tracking appears to be fully implemented but might not be working due to:
1. No active API key selected (activeKeyId is null)
2. The mock service being used instead of the real one
3. SharedPreferences not persisting data correctly

### 💡 Quick Fix to Test:

Add this temporary code to MainViewModel to force usage tracking:
```kotlin
// In summarize() method after successful API call
viewModelScope.launch {
    delay(1000) // Wait for API call to complete
    val keyManager = (getApplication() as SumUpApplication).enhancedApiKeyManager
    keyManager.activeKeyId.value?.let { keyId ->
        keyManager.updateKeyUsage(keyId)
        Log.d("MainViewModel", "Force updated usage for key: $keyId")
    }
}
```
